    <h2>1. Have a Glass of Milk Every Day
    </h2>
    <p> As a staple food that is a perfect accompaniment to chocolate chip cookies, a glass of milk is loaded with 13 essential nutrients, including bone-building calcium, protein and magnesium. Yet, as nutrient-dense as milk is, most adults don't drink even one glass of this beverage a day. If milk tends to bother your gut, try lactose-free milk or A2 milk to see if these options help.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eat Breakfast
    </h2>
    <p>We have all been told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And research highlights exactly why this is.eating breakfast consistently is linked to a greater intake of many nutrients, including folate, calcium and iron.<br/>This study also suggests that breakfast skippers tend to consume significantly more calories, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat and added sugars during lunch, dinner and snacks than people who eat breakfast.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Plan Your Meals
    </h2>
    <p>Meal planning can help people eat a healthier diet and reduce the stress of trying to figure out what to eat at the last minute. Taking the time to plan out your meals for the week can help you navigate your healthy eating with ease.<br/> To meal-plan, figure out what you are going to eat for your meals throughout the week. Make yourself a shopping list and prep your ingredients for quick meals for the entire week.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Avoid Eating the Same Foods on Repeat
    </h2>
    <p>To eat a healthy diet, variety is key. Eating a wide variety of foods will give your body different nutrients and may help prevent nutritional gaps.<br/> One strategy that many dietitians recommend is to "eat the rainbow," meaning that people should aim to eat foods that naturally contain a wide variety of colors throughout the week.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Prep Your Veggies
    </h2>
    <p>Before you put your groceries away after your shopping haul, prep your veggies before you store them in the fridge. Having chopped onions and sliced cucumbers on hand makes it incredibly easy to add good-for-you vegetables to your dishes or for grab-and-go snacks.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limit Fried Foods
    </h2>
    <p> Eating too many fried foods is linked to a slew of unsavory health outcomes. It might even impact your mental health. Regularly eating fried foods increases the risk of cardiovascular disease—and the relationship is linear, meaning, your risk of disease goes up the more you eat fried foods.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Add More Vegetables to Your Dishes
    </h2>
    <p> Vegetables are one of the best sources of fiber, a nutrient that can help keep your body healthy by supporting gut health and possibly reducing the risk of developing certain cancers. Plus, many veggies are low in calories and can help make dishes a bit more satisfying and flavorful.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Avoid Eating in Front of the TV
    </h2>
    <p> Your meals are meant to be enjoyed. And when you eat while watching TV, you can end up being distracted and ultimately eat more calories while feeling less satisfied.simply make sure you are not distracted by the TV.<br/> Eating without distractions allows you to eat mindfully, which means you can pay attention to your body's cues when it's had enough to eat.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Include Fermented Food in Your Diet
    </h2>
    <p> Kimchi, sauerkraut and other fermented foods not only taste delish, but they also fuel the body with live probiotics that support our overall health in various ways. To give your body a boost of probiotics, start your day with plain yogurt, enjoy a miso soup at dinnertime or sip on a kombucha midday for some fermented goodness.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Add Fruit to Your Midday Snack
    </h2>
    <p>Combining a serving of fruit with protein can help give your snack some staying power, so you will feel satisfied and avoid a potential sugar crash shortly after eating. If you don't have fresh fruit at your fingertips, know that dried, freeze-dried, frozen and canned fruit are all healthy options as well, as long as they don't contain added salt or sugar.</p>
